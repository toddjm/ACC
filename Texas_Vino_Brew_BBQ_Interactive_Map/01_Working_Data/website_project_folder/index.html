<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my interactive map of Texas wine, beer, and barbecue locations.
<br /> 
By clicking on the <a href="map.html">Interactive Map</a> link on the navigation bar on the left, you
	will be transported to an interactive experience featuring the Texas Historical Commission's
	Texas Heritage Trails project.
</p>
<p>
You can select by region, trail, type of venue, or search by name.
</p>


<h2>But is it <em>easy</em> to Use?</h2>
<p>Sure - point and click!
</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the Zoom function (to go to a particular region) and be sure to stay
safe when you're out there sampling that vino and beer!</p>
